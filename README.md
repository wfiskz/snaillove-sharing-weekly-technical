iSO:a summary about how to choosing a library of network requests 

By comparing the most popular librarys recently, including ASIHTTPRequest, AFNetworking, MKNetworkKit and YTKNetwork, get the following conclusions:

1.ASIHTTPRequest: (https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request)   
    a classic network request frame. ASIHTTPRequest is packaged on the C' CFNetwork, so it's the most powerfulnetwork framework and
have many considerable advantages.ASIHTTPRequest could meet any needs of function, but It hasn't been updated for a long time and cause lots of bug and compatibility Issues, so abandon it.

2.AFNetworking: (https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)   
    The most popular network request frame, it has 25953 star on GitHub now. the difference to ASIHTTPRequest is AFNetworking
ispackaged on the OC' NSURLSession and NSURLConnection. AFNetworking is not stronger than ASIHTTPRequest, but AFNetworking focus on network data transmission, network and multi-threaded processing and it is very simple to use.So is AFNetworking is recommended.

3.MKNetworkKit: (https://github.com/luisobo/Nocilla)   
    MKNetworkKit is very easy to use, but functional and powerful, it is a total iOS network programming code libraries, based on the
ARC entirely. MKNetworkKit has only two classes, the goal of MKNetworkKit is to use like AFNetworking simply, but have powerful functions like ASIHTTPRequest.Although it have many advantages,but various CRASH,debugging useless and lack of datas is MKNetworkKit's fatal flaw.

4.YTKNetwork: (https://github.com/yuantiku/YTKNetwork)   
    YTKNetwork is a iOS network library packaged based AFNetworking by YTK iOS development team, it provides a set of High Level API
and higher level of network access abstraction.Such as legitimacing by time or version number requested content caching network, check the returned JSON content, batch network request filter and plug-in mechanism and so so. So if you wanan do that's fountions, YTKNetwork is recommended.

For a summary, AFNetworking and YTKNetwork are recommended for diffrient needs and their different functions.

####1.Why C language has the function name with abbreviation,for example,"printf",but why some other programming language Objective-C has the long and full function name?

I think one of the most important is that we have excellent IDE for coding.We can easily remembered by the IDE reminder,we don't need to remember every word of the function name and also we are easy to know what this function does from the long and full name of the function.But we need to remember the full function name while we didn't have the excellent IDE before!

####2.Why Objective-C .m files use m extension?

From the book "Learn Objective-C on the Mac" by Mark Dalrymple and Scott Knaster, page 9:

>"The .m extension originally stood for "**m**essages" when Objective-C was first introduced, referring to a central feature of Objective-C [...]"

####3.How to solve the problem that when we add .gitignore file after you have already commited,or you have modified the .gitignore file while .gitignore file has no effect? 

A:In the Git code management,when we add .gitignore file after you have already commited,or you have ADDED some files,directories or kinds of files.The following git command will help you to make the .gitignore file effect:

>`git rm -r –cached .`

>`git add .`

>`git commit -m "Refresh .gitignore file."`

A:In the Git code management,when we have REMOVED some files,directories or kinds of files.The following git command will help you to make the .gitignore file effect：

>`git add -f *.[file type]`

>`git commit -m "Refresh removing *.* from .gitignore file."`
